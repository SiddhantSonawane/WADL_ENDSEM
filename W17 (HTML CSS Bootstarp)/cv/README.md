## W17. Create your own webpage using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap called "index.html". It 
should have:
a. A title
b. Three or more types of headings
c. Some paragraphs
d. One or more ordered lists
e. One or more unordered lists
f. One or more tables
g. Some line-breaks
h. Some horizontal lines
i. Some comments
j. Various text styles: bold, italic, strike-through, underline
Make sure that the file is reasonably large: 2-3 screens worth at least. (You can add 
dummy content if you wish).
2. View the above HTML file on a browser, using a URL such as: 
http://localhost/index.html OR double click on html file.
3. Learn to look at the HTML source from the browser window.
4. Now create some internal bookmarks and links using the "name=xyz" property and 
"href=#xyz". Type the URLs for these internal bookmarks directly onto the browser.
5. Now split your webpage into multiple HTML files, or equivalently create more HTML 
files. For example, you may have a separate HTML file describing your interests or 
educational background. Provide links from the main index.html to these other HTML 
files. Provide also some links to external websites (e.g. google).
6. Now move all the HTML files to another directory. Your links should still work (they 
should be relative links).
7. Embed one or more images in any of the HTML files. The images should reside 
within a sub-directory called "images".
8. Now include some styles within HTML tag elements. For example: table border, cell 
background, link color, text color, background color, list style, text font, etc.
9. Now include some of the earlier styles in the "style" tag of the HTML "head" section, 
instead of marking the styles in individual HTML tag elements.
10. Now have a separate css file for the above styles, so that the same can be 
included in multiple HTML files.
11. Insert some special characters such as &, <, >, etc. in your HTML file.
